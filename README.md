Machine Learning: model optimization through hyperparameters

In this project I worked with hyperparameters and parameter spaces;
I explored spaces in a deterministic way;
I optimized my models and avoided overfitting;
I implemented exploitation behind the scenes; 
Finally, I learned to use and explore with GridSearchCV and nested cross validation.
